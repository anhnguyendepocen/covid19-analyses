# Introduction {#intro}

These notes have three goals: 

1. illustrate some advanced features in the statistics package [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (e.g., web scraping, git repositories, animated plots, nonlinear mixed model regressions, interactive SIR models), 

2. illustrate a reproducible workflow for analyses and report writing, and 

3. use data from the covid-19 pandemic to reinforce and expand some of the material we covered this year. 


In these notes I will not be able to address issues of specificity and sensitivity of the covid-19 tests because I don't have access to information about the tests' false positive and false negative rates.   Further, there appear to be different tests in use, tests from different vendors, new tests coming on line  frequently, etc., which increases the complexity in understanding the counts of "confirmed" covid-19 cases. Also, it is too early to develop population models of the baseline proportions of who has the disease.  Without knowing the base rates of the disease and the specificity/sensitivity of the available tests, we are at a major disadvantage for using the usual tools (e.g., Bayesian statistics) to evaluate such matters.  I find it strange that public health officials  talk about increasing the throughput of tests (e.g., on 3/29/20 a report indicated a new test that gives a result in 5 minutes) without discussing error rates of false positives and false negatives.  An inexpensive test that can deliver a result in 5 minutes but has a relatively high false negative rate (i.e., people who are sick test negative) may do more harm than good. Further, at this point establishing base rates of the disease from positive test results and other indicators such as hospitalizations and deaths is not straightforward (e.g., testing in the US at least is currrently done following a set of criteria such as showing symptoms so merely examining positive counts, as I do in these notes, can lead to biased estimates of the incidence of the disease).

The Wiki page on [sensitivity and specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) offers a basic introduction (and you'll see related concepts from Lecture Notes 1 on hypothesis testing); much of the original work on test evaluation was done between the 1940s and 1960s including the work by University of Michigan's own Green and Swets (1966) on [signal detection theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_theory).   I recently found an article about the specificity and sensitivity of the coronavirus tests in the [Washington Post 3/26/20](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/03/26/negative-coronavirus-test-result-doesnt-always-mean-you-arent-infected/). Not sure if it is behind a pay wall but worth a look if you are interested.  Some of the companies developing tests are not posting information about the sensitivity and specificity (e.g., [ARUP's website](https://www.aruplab.com/infectious-disease/coronavirus) states, 3/24/20,  "At this point, ARUP is unable to share our sensitivity and specificity data, but they will be very similar to those established by Hologic.") 

We can still learn useful information from studying counts of confirmed cases of disease.  The most famous example of examining the patterns of counts comes from the cholera outbreak in London in the mid 1800s, before the germ theory of disease was developed. Cholera produces severe diarrhea, it is caused by a bacteria and can lead to death.  The residents of London where experiencing a severe outbreak leading to about 500 deaths in 10 days.  Now we know that clean drinking water (free from sewage) and non-contaminated foods are the best way to control cholera, but back then they didn't understand much about the cause or spread of this disease. John Snow's contribution was to collect data on where the cholera deaths occurred.  He noticed that the deaths tended to be clustered in houses near particular water pumps. In those days, you would walk to the nearest water pump to fill up your jugs with the daily supply of water. People tend to go to the same water pump every day, so households would drink water from the same water pump. Snow started keeping track of which households developed cholera, where there were deaths and he found clustering near particular water pumps.  His observations led to the handle from one water pump, the Broad Street Pump, being removed to stop water usage at that location. This was an early form of a public health intervention. Cholera cases began to decrease as people sourced water from other pumps. Later, it was discovered that this particular pump was contaminated by the sanitation waste from a nearby home. We do not have additional information, such as the number of residents around each water pump, making it difficult to evaluate the clustering of deaths around specific locations (i.e.,  those may have been the locations where more people lived).  But still, counts can provide useful information if used carefully.
