# Conclusion

These notes took a relatively high level perspective on the modeling of testing data. 

Overall, there is a sense that these models are not very satisfying. They operate at one level of analysis: counts on aggregate geographic areas such as countries and states.  They don't get into levels of specific human behavior nor evaluation of policies, contextual factors, health disparities and other aspects that wouldn't be too difficult to gather even more relevant data and build more complex models.   

But there are also other levels that these notes have been quite silent about---the biological level. The SARS-CoV-2 virus itself has many levels of analysis such as molecular, cellular, and genetic as well as complex interactions that we are just beginning to understand in how the virus interacts with its environment (e.g., how it travels in air, how long it can live on a surface, how it interacts with the host).
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPtH42Lnt_Y) is a wonderful video on some relevant biology including what the SARS-CoV-2 virus does to the lungs and how in some people it causes [Acute Respitory Distress Syndrome](https://www.thoracic.org/patients/patient-resources/breathing-in-america/resources/chapter-2-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome.pdf) (ARDS).  ARDS is a common cause of death among individuals with covid-19, which occurs because of the massive inflammatory reaction that covid-19 patients experience. 

I would love to see deeper models that integrate the biological, behavioral, social and epidemiological factors.  No single level of analysis will help us figure out how to best respond to all aspects of the current pandemic.  


Right before the covid-19 pandemic occurred,  our lab was about to launch a study with two collaborators (critical care doctors) on survivors of ARDS. Patients can take up to a year to recover from ARDS, even getting up from a chair can make these survivors winded. I had been learning a lot about ARDS when the pandemic started. One key piece of information I picked up from one of our collaborators ([Jack Iwashyna](https://ihpi.umich.edu/our-experts/tiwashyn)) is that the human lung is a poorly designed system. If we wanted to design a way to bring oxygen into our body, process it, and eliminate the waste product, CO2, we wouldn't have a designed what is essentially a sac where good air comes in from the top and the bad air goes out the same way the good air came in.  An inhalation brings O2 in, an exhalation forces CO2 out.  If the "sac" fills with liquid or is affected by inflammation, we can experience major complications. The [gills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_gill) in fish are more efficient than our lungs for processing oxygen: as water flows through,  the gills extract O2. Unfortunately, when the pandemic is over there will be a large pool of ARDS survivors that we will be able to recruit into our study.
